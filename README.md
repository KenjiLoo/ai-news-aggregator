# AI News Aggregator
Using GPT-4 and Serper, the model plays 2 roles, the researcher and the broadcaster. The researcher browses the top latest news about a certain news topic, and hands the insights to the broadcaster. The broadcaster then summarizes the insights into effective bullet points.

#To Run 
Feel free to fork the repo, and create an .env file with your OpenAI API key and your Serper API key. Change up the prompts to be whatever you want it to be and click run!
(I'm not sharing my openai api and serper api i bought with my hard earned money!)

# Pending
A UI is currently in progress, where it allows users to input a certain topic of their interest. I'm planning to deploy it using vercel's free service, but till then I'll be working on improving the prompts.
